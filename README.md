## Part 1 Info
The notebook scripts needed for part 1 are called "Part 1.1- Data Clean" and "Part 1.2- Load to GBQ". Please note that for Part 1.2, there are similarly named variables that do the basic functions. However, since it works the first time I ran it, I did not want to reduce the variables in case it broke the code.

The folders that are part of part 1 are ZipFiles (which is where the uncleaned zipped files are), WedgeZipFiles (the orginal zip of zips) and temp_clean (where the cleaned unzipped files are). Due to the size, all of these are in gitignore.

The results for my queries are in file: "gbq_assessment_query_results .txt"

## Part 2 Info
The notebook script needed for part 2 is "Part 2- Owner Samples". This produces the output file called Sample_Owners.txt which is aboit 291 MB (slightly over 250MB, it was difficult to get exactly 250 MB). Due to size, the output file is also in the gitignore.


## Part 3 Info

The notebook script needed for part 3 is "Part 3-Summary Tables". The results from the queries are stored in text files: "query1", "query2", and "query3" which are all in gitignore due to some size issues. The database that holds the tables for these files is called "WEDGE.db" which is in the gitignore due to size.


## Comments Section
John- can you please review my code and let me know if I need to make corrections?
